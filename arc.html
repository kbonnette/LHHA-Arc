The <b>start date</b> for your project must allow adequate time for the ARC committee to review your request. To avoid approval delays on an extensive/complicated project, additional explanatory materials (i.e. architectural drawings, sketches, pictures, contractor's specifications, paint samples, site/landscape plans, list of materials, etc.) must be included with the request. The time cycle allowed by the covenants for your request to be processed does not begin until the ARC request is considered complete.
